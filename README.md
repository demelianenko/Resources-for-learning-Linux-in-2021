# Resources for learning Linux in 2021

[TOC]

------

## Why?

There isn't seem to be a good resource list for leaning Linux in 2021, I will keep updating it as I go. I will be linking subreddits YouTube videos and such.


## First step, Hand holding.

I would highly recommend to start with [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/), You can follow in on their subreddit: [r/linuxupskillchallenge](https://reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/) 
Do it at your own pace if you need more time you can always refer to the GitHub page. If you feel confident and its easy do more!

## Tipping your toes

So you have been hand held but you want more? [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is an amazing none profit organization that as the name suggests teaches coding but they do a lot more than that!
An amazing video I would suggest to watch is the:
[Linux Server Course - System Configuration and Operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMy3OzvBWc0)

## Going for a daily swim

Next logical step if you have done all the above would be to install Linux on a virtual machine using:

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

- Bare metal (an Old laptop for example)

  ### Shallow waters before the ocean

  A few recommended distributions for new swimmers:

  - [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
  - [Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/): Ubuntu with [KDE](http://www.kde.org/).
  - [Ubuntu Gnome](http://ubuntugnome.org/): Ubuntu with the [Gnome Shell](http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/).
  - [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/)
  - [elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org/)
  - [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
